                In your first 24 hours in Miami, you’ll stroll among Art Deco architecture on Ocean Drive in South Beach.
                You browse street art in Wynwood and shop in the Miami Design District.
                You’ll feel the pulse of Cuba & Latin America in Little Havana. 
                And you’ll chill out with a cocktail in hand to Atlantic Ocean sea breezes as the sun sets behind you.

                Where to go in Miami in one day: A complete 24-hour itinerary
                Watch the sunrise at South Beach
                Only got one day in Miami? Start your day with a walk around South Beach.

                If you’re an early riser, you’re in luck: Miami Beach unleashes some incredible sunrises. 
                The early morning hours, before the crowds ascend, are among the best times to roam about the South Beach area.
                For beach-bums, South Beach is the ultimate hangout spot on a Miami itinerary. 
                South Beach isn’t just one of the most popular beaches in Miami;
                 it’s often listed as one of the best beaches in the USA. 
                 It’s not often that you’ll find such an amazing seaside experience within a major urban center!

                Even if you don’t want to spend much time frolicking in the water,
                 South Beach is a fantastic place for a stroll. 
                 Enjoy the sea views and grab some shade in the palm-shaded Lummus Park to escape the Miami heat.

                 Wander around the Art Deco District
                Besides its sunrises and white sands, Miami Beach is most renowned for its Art Deco District. 
                Centered around Ocean Drive, the Art Deco Historic District contains over 800 historic buildings.</blockquote></article>
