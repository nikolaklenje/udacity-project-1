               <article><h3>Miami, Florida,</h3> is an undeniably desirable place to live.
                 People from all over the U.S. and the rest of the world flock to the vibrant metro area to live, work, vacation, and retire—
                 and it’s easy to see its appeal!
                
               The Magic City is the second-largest metropolis on the East Coast and the seventh-largest in the country. 
                It’s the only major U.S. city founded by a woman, and with over 300 high-rise towers, it boasts the third-tallest American skyline.
                 There’s a lot to love about this cultural, economic, and financial hub in South Florida, but if you’re thinking about living there,
                 it’s still worth researching the advantages and potential setbacks.</article></div>
